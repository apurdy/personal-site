I’m a born and raised Maritimer living and working in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I’m educated as an industrial engineer and am currently pursuing a career at the intersection of analytics, automation, process improvement and productivity. I’ve made it a professional goal to try and make data exciting and actionable in order to help organizations foster a data-driven business culture.

On this site you might find a little bit of everything… but mostly posts about things that I’m most interested in, such as analytics, data viz, technology, running, sports, nature and cats.
